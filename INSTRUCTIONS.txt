Also keep in mind, this software is BETA. This means
can go wrong and/or may not function 100% or even the 
way you'd prefer them.

Disclaimer:
This software is NOT to be sold for various reasons.
One of which, and most importantly, I have material
such as images and or logos that are copywritten, 
and/or trademarked to FS. Legally, this software 
CANNOT be sold due to restrictions with the afformentioned.
Also, I personally find it ridiculous to sell software
that is to be used with a FREE game.

This software is meant to be used as is and I assume
no responsibilty for loss of time or potential damage
or harm to any machine or software component therein.
Though there isn't a bit of code in my software that 
can harm your box, I still must offer this disclaimer
for those that may find some way to unintentionally
screw something up :P

	There are 202 files/directories. All of which are named below.
A-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A


B: 
B-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------B
Change the file permissions of every file in the "/includes" directory to 0666.

B-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------B


C:
C-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------C
1. Point your browser to the install directory and follow the instructions. (/urstats/install/)
2. !IMPORTANT! After successful installation and creation of the Primary User, you MUST DELETE the /install/ directory!
3. Navigate your browser to your installation.
4. Log in. Click on Admin. Click on Go button beside Manage Servers to Add a server.
5. Create any additional Users. Only Super Admins will have access to the Admin area! This should be reserved for server/clan owners! All others should just be Admin.
6. Create any additional Rules you would like to add to auto-ban. 
7. Enjoy! Again, if you have any question/concerns/comments, let me know - alphahusky@gmail.com or visit me at: http://www.alphahusky.info

****************************ADDITIONAL NOTES*******************************
=-=-=-RCON=-=-=-
I've also designed URsTats to log EVERY command by every user that uses the Console Emulators.
Right now, there is no way to look at the log without direct access to your database. (Coming soon though).
URsTats is also designed so that clan/server owners/leaders, never have to give out their RCON password.
This way, when an Admin decides to become rogue.. well.. Just delete his/her name from URsTats and 
he will no longer have access to anything and you don't have to change your RCON password :P
If, in the event, someone tries to access the RCON password by means of the Console Emulator, 
the console will give an ERROR stating they are not allowed to use this command. All commands MUST
be entered WITHOUT the word "rcon" preceeding the command. Otherwise, it WILL return an error!

=-=-=-ADDITIONAL CVARS=-=-=-
I have added two CVARS that can be use ONLY in the Console Emulators.
For now, these CVARS can ONLY be used on the box that URsTats is installed.
You must create a file called slap_script.cfg in your q3ut4 directory.
Change the file permissions to 777.
Change the $script_path in the defs.php file to server path of your
q3ut4 directory as shown in the example above.

These 2 CVARS are:
(Note: DO NOT USE QUOTES when issuing either command. The software already does that :P)

bigslap:
Description: This CVAR will slap a player to death and issue text to the player it is invoked against.
Usage:  bigslap <player_id> <text>
		Player_id: This is the player number of the player you want to invoke this command upon. This switch is NOT optional.
		Text: This will be the quoted text you issue with this command. This text will only appear to the player in which the command is invoked against. This switch is optional.
Example: bigslap 0 You need to stop being an asshat.

pwnkick:
Description: This CVAR will first send a message to all players in the server with a custom or pre-defined message. It will then slap the player (in which the command was issued against) to death. Finally, the script will proceed to kick that player.
Usage:  pwnkick <player_id> <text>
		Player_id: This is the player number of the player you want to invoke this command upon. This switch is NOT optional.
		Text: This will be the quoted text you issue with this command. This text will appear to all players . This switch is optional.
Example: pwnkick 0 Come back when you can respect our rules!
